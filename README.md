# Facility Meltdown

The apparatus was a vital part of the upkeep of the facility's nuclear reactor - and you just took it out.

With the facility meltdown mod the appartus has a lot more risk (and reward) attached to it. When you take it out the entire facility spirals into a self destruction sequence! You'll have 2 minutes to escape and take off before you get vaporized.

Take a look at the known isuses if you have a problem, otherwise join the [lethal company modding discord](https://discord.gg/lcmod) and find the FacilityMeltdown thread and report it there!

## Config
Only the host needs to change their config as it is synced. 

### OPTIONAL ingame config editors
[lethalconfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) or [lethalsettings](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/willis81808/LethalSettings/) will let you edit the settings in-game.

## Known Issues
There has been previous reports of modded moons not playing well with this mod! As always go over to the [lethal company modding discord](https://discord.gg/lcmod) and I can try and take a look. There seems to be no problem with Lethal Level Loader or LECore so it could be map dependent. In which case I wil NOT be fixing it. I can not fix every modded moon in this mod otherwise I would get nothing done.
